# Employee Payroll-Tracker

Week 3 Challenge - Create an employee payroll tracker using JavaScript.

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a payroll tracking program that allowed for individual employee input. I created this project to further understand and implement JavaScript in a realistic application. Through this project I have learned a method of generating a random number within an index and using that to pull informaiton from said index. I have also gained considerable comfortability with While and For loops as well as concatting within a console log.
